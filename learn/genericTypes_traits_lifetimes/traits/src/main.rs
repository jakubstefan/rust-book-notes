/* We have multiple structs that hold various kinds and amounts of text: a
NewsArticle struct that holds a news story filed in a particular location and a
Tweet that can have, at most, 280 characters along with metadata that indicates
whether it was a new tweet, a retweet, or a reply to another tweet.

We want to make a media aggregator library crate named aggregator that can display
summaries of data that might be stored in a NewsArticle or Tweet instance. To do
this, we need a summary from each type, and weâ€™ll request that summary by calling
a summarize method on an instance. Listing 10-12 shows the definition of a public
Summary trait that expresses this behavior.

Each type implementing this trait must provide its own custom behavior for the body of the method.
